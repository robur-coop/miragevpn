## OpenVPN library purely in OCaml

OpenVPN creates secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.
It uses TLS to establish a (mutually) authenticated connection, over which material to derive the symmetric keys for packet encryption is exchanged.

The goal of this project is to provide:
- A pure library implementing the protocol logic, and the OpenVPN config file format to enable interoperabilty and a smooth transition for existing deployments.
- A [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) unikernel that acts as an OpenVPN client.

Our goal is not to implement the complete protocol, but rather a small useful subset with modern crypto and the latest key exchange methods, without deprecated or redundant features
(embodying the philosophy of [nqsb-tls](https://nqsb.io)).  An initial draft of the network setup is depicted in the diagram below:

![diagram](/diagrams/multi-stack.svg)

Since OpenVPN is not detailed in a protocol specificaton specified, apart from comments in the header files, we have written a specification document in Markdown, still work in progress:

  - [spec.md](https://git.robur.io/?p=openvpn-spec.git;a=blob_plain;f=spec.md;hb=HEAD)

Our OpenVPN configuration parser can be tested with an OpenVPN configuration file:

  - `./_build/default/app/openvpn_config_parser.exe my.openvpn.conf`

# Unix client `openvpn_client_lwt`

Included in this repository is a unix program that will connect to an
OpenVPN server, open a `tun` interface, and tunnel packets between
the two.

## Unix client on Linux

There are two ways to open `tun` interfaces:
1) Using a dynamically allocated interface (`dev tun`).
   In order to dynamically allocate a `tun` interface, the process will need
   privileges to do so. Either by running the client as `root` or with
   the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privilege.
   You would then add `dev tun` to your configuration file.
2) Using a preallocated interface (`dev tunX`)
   This is the recommend configuration.
   To allocate such an interface for `tun5` you can use this command:
   ```shell
   sudo ip tuntap add mode tun user MYUSERNAME name tun5
   ```
   You would then add `dev tun5` to your configuration file.

```shell
dune build

# Bestowing the binary with CAP_NET_ADMIN if using dynamic tun allocation:
sudo setcap cap_net_admin=ep ./_build/default/app/openvpn_client_lwt.exe

./_build/default/app/openvpn_client_lwt.exe -v MY-CONFIG-FILE.CONF
```

# OpenVPN-compatible config parser

Our goal has been to implement a usable subset (as found in various
 real-world configuration files available to us during the implementation
 phase).

As far as possible we have strived to derive a representation that does not
 permit ambiguity or conflicting options to be present in the parsed config.
Consult the `type 'a k` declaration in `openvpn_config.mli` for more
 information.

This does not mean that conflicting options cannot be accepted from an on-disk
 configuration file, but rather that such conflicts are explicitly handled in
 the parser code (specifically in the `resolve_conflict` function).

A notable difference from OpenVPN configuration parser is that we treat relative
 paths in a configuration file to be relative to the configuration file
 location, and not relative to the current working directory. OpenVPN supports
 a `--cd` argument, which we do not.

## Supported config directives

Here is a list of configuration directives supported by this parser.

**NB: These are supported by the _parser_, not necessarily supported
by the _unikernel_ or _client_ executables. TODO document that subset somewhere,
and maybe check upon initialization that we understand all the options given?**

Directives that call for an external file to be read (or can be
 supplied inline with the `[inline]` stanza):
```
auth-nocache
auth-user-pass FILE-PATH
ca FILE-PATH
cert FILE-PATH
connection FILE-PATH
key FILE-PATH
pkcs12 FILE-PATH

tls-auth FILE-PATH
tls-auth FILE-PATH 0
tls-auth FILE-PATH 1
# the 0/1 here is the keydirection: 0 for CN_OUTGOING; 1 for CN_INCOMING
```

```
